### Plotly Challenge

## General Information
In this challenge I used Javascript and Plot.ly to make loops, condtionals, and visualize a JSON dataset. I start off by creating variables and linking the JSON and the URl. After that I wrote code that made the drop down menu have all the id's of each sample in the dataset. then I created a loop that will change the webpage if the drop down menu item changes. I then developed code to move the meta data in the JSON to the Demographics info panel on the website. I then created a bubble plot that compares the number of times the UTI appears in each sample. I then created a bar chart that shows the top ten UTI's in each sample.

## Technologies used 
* Javascript
* Plot.ly
* VS code
* HTML

## Important notes/Issues
* The bubble plot functions properly but does not show all the data so i will fix then with a future push.
